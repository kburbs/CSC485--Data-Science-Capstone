Here is a sample weekly update/planner as a markdown (md) file. Markdown is a useful file type to be familiar with because Jupyter nodebooks have their text components in markdown. [Here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is a website with all of the common formatting rules. [Here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) is a cheat sheet which is more compact.

Goals for this week:

- [ ] Begin process of moving model work in sheets to R 
- [ ] Build an Igloo/ snow fort
- [ ] Sleep and enjoy the snow

(Notice the specific format for the checklist. A space between the dash and the brackets, a space between brackets if not yet complete, and an x if completed. You can see how this in the raw format becomes a nice checklist when rendered.)


#### Reflections:

Didn't create a to-do last week, looking forward to building the rest of the model and eventually seeing how it holds up throughout the semester.
