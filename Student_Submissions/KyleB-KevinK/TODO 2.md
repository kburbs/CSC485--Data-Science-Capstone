To Do



Week of 1/26

* Get formulas to be consistent from excel to Rstudio
* Fix issues with needing to select model from file explorer on every run
* Get results to match those in excel
* make sure we have the most efficient way of converting formulas in rstudio
* Develop some sort of visual representation of our returns vs online findings


Week of 2/1

Results from last week:
* Fixed formula consistency
* Matched outputs in excel and R model
* Began developing visualizations

TO-DO
* Work on building + back testing a new formula for u0.5 team totals
* Create multiple visualizations for profit/betting results
* Visualizations we want to build:
  * Profit by +EV Range
  * Win rate by +EV Range
  * ROI % by +EV Range
  
Week of 2/8

Results from last week:
* Created all three visualizations for betting results
* Created and backtested the three new formulas for u0.5 TT runs, the original
formula seemed to be off more than usual, built a strict poisson calculation,
following that up with a hybrid version, combining both poisson and the original
calculation - which seems to give the fairest odds and percentages according
to the u0.5 bets tracked from the summer. 

TO-DO
* Continue back testing new formula
* Create variance and projection (ROI? Profit?) visualizations for betting records
* Create visualizations for R model, looking to create heatmaps for finding sweet
spots for certain teams, matchups etc.
* Begin researching and thinking about how the model could improve accuracy 
through player statistics. (Beginning with closers for each team)
